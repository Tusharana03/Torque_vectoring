# Torque_vectoring
## Compatibility -
For best results this package should be run using the following software versions.

- Matlab (2018a) 
- CarMaker (7.0.2)

To run the software model go to the "FS_Generic_Plus_Schanzer_2019" folder then "src_cm4sl" folder.
Inside "src_cm4sl" folder open Torque_Vectoring_Schanzer20.slx file with SIMULINK.
Several simulink blocks can only be used when IPG CarMaker of above mentioned version is also installed.
Once the SIMULINK model is open navigate back from the model to open the first interface page of CarMaker & SIMULINK integration. There is an option to open CarMaker Gui. In car maker check for the folder/project directory, it should be same as where all the files of this model are stored on the Hard disk.
Once the CarMaker is connected with the project open the test named "testfsgen" and select the vehicle "FSE_Schanzer20" to run the simulation.
